Which Repo? We encourage performing releases directly from a clone of the official repository rather than a fork to avoid extra steps. This means when testing on uPortal-start for the release, you should use the apereo repository but configure the version of the component (eg the Bookmarks or Announcements portlet) to be the SNAPSHOT version that you'll build in the following steps. Testing Build a clean version of uPortal-start with the quickstart data set and perform at least light testing, especially around features that have been fixed or enhanced. Prepare For Testing Check the styling: $ mvn notice:generate $ mvn license:format $ mvn javadoc:fix Review any changes from the styling tasks and commit them. If you run into issues with the Maven task not finding licenses for dependencies, Maven will create a dependency mapping file that you should fold into the primary license-mapping.xml file located at https://github.com/Jasig/apereo-parent/blob/master/licenses/license-mappings.xml . Install the build locally: $ mvn clean install Ideally, committers will be running the mvn notice , license , and javadoc before they commit changes to the repo. If there are changes needed, review the differences, and then commit to master : $ git commit -am \"chore: pre-release prep\" Point your uPortal-start to the local component build: Using the component's version, configure uPortal-start to pick it up in .../apereo/uPortal-start/gradle.properties . For example, if you are building version 3.5.1-SNAPSHOT of the Bookmarks portlet, you'd configure .../apereo/uPortal-start/gradle.properties with bookmarksPortletVersion=3.5.1-SNAPSHOT . Run uPortal-start with the local build $ ./gradlew clean portalInit Verify Unit tests are automatically run on commits, so ensure the latest commit's CI build passed. FUTURE - Need to run the cross browser platform tests and the performance tests Smoke test the UI manually of the component Pay attention to new changes Cut Release If you had to commit changes for the styling, push them to the repo. Run the following command in the directory of the component's clone. If this is your first time, run each release: command separately so if there's a failure in the process, it'll be easier to diagnose and restart. $ mvn release:clean release:prepare release:perform :Note: During the release tasks, you will be prompted for a release version (e.g. 3.5.1 ), release tag, and new development version. Press Enter for the defaults. The release process will then create two commits - a commit to set the new version ( 3.5.1 ), and a commit to set the version to the new snapshot ( 3.5.2-SNAPSHOT ) Close and Release from Nexus Staging Repository Close the release in Sonatype to ensure the pushed Maven artifacts pass checks: 1. Log into https://oss.sonatype.org 2. Search among Build Promotion > Staging Repositories for your username 3. Review the release for the expected artifacts 4. Select the uPortal artifact you staged and hit \"Close\" - The lifecycle is Open --> Closed --> Released 5. Wait a few minutes for the component's artifact to close 6. Release the artifact, and put the tag name in the description - Leave 'Automatically Drop' checked. Create Release Notes Use Git to inspect the incremental commits since the last release (e.g. $ git log v3.5.0..3.5.1 --no-merges ) Review the issue tracker and confirm that the referenced issues have been Resolved Enter the release notes on the GitHub releases page in the component's repo It's helpful to use the previous release notes as a guide Each commit type goes into a sub section with the type as a header (Fixes, Chores, Features, etc...). Update uPortal-start Open a Pull Request on uPortal-start to update the version of the newly released component. Do a quick smoke test to ensure it built: $ cd {uPortal-start repo} $ ./gradlew tomcatStop .../uPortal-start$ ./gradlew clean tomcatDeploy .../uPortal-start$ ./gradlew tomcatStart Publish new docker demo of Quickstart Publish a new apereo/uPortal-demo Docker image and update the :latest tag. Prerequisites: - Docker Cloud account ( https://cloud.docker.com ) - Access to post to the apereo Docker group - The uPortal version has been added to uPortal-start $ cd {uPortal-start repo} $ ./gradlew dockerBuildImageDemo $ docker login $ docker tag {version in format like 5.1.0} apereo/uportal-demo:latest $ docker push apereo/uportal-demo:latest Update Community For any non-snapshot release, email an announcement to uportal-dev and uportal-user . - Be sure to acknowledge those who contributed to the release. - Be sure to put the release into context for existing adopters to understand.
